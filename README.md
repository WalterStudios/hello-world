Hello Dev World!

This is the debut project of WalterStudios, a two man development firm based in
Philadelphia that specializes in web-design, business solutions, and educational applications.

Actually, this is just GitHub's tutorial project. We have no idea what we're doing here...

But we learn fast, so stick around. Great things await!
